## WaterQualityPrediction_AICTE 
This project aims to predict multiple water quality parameters using machine learning techniques, specifically MultiOutputRegressor wrapped around a RandomForestRegressor
## Submission
Final project Submission.
## Overview 
It is a 4 week Internship By ** EDUNET ** 
Access to clean water is a critical global concern. Accurate prediction of various water quality metrics can help in early detection of pollution and ensure timely intervention.
In This project we have done
** Week1: Importing neccessary libraries, Data collection, Data loading, Data Manuplation.
** Week2: Handling the missing values in the data by using **DROP() , Training and Testing the dataset and Built a pipeline using MultiOutputRegressor with RandomForestRegressor and Evaluated the model using appropriate regression metrics.
** Week3: writing a Script file for the Deployment and Evaluating the Output.
** Week4: Creating a Presentation on the project and submitting the presentation and the Source code.

## Improvisation :
At the last I have added some Visualization that I have perfomed on the dataset.
** Visualizations: **Scatter plot, **Line Graph, **pie Chart.
